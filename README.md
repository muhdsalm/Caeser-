# Caeser++ - The stupidly simple encryption program that _anyone_ can use
Did you know that Discord tracks you and sells this to companies? Me neither. However, a quick stroll through youtube reveals many videos on this topic. Of course, it's not like I'm saying it's a fact, but then I realized... it's actually possible.

Now, if you don't want your chats to be tracked, there's an amazing solution. A brilliant project named Tox is available, a p2p e2e encrypted chat protocol used by apps like utox and qtox. However, discord is a feature-rich app (and it looks good) so moving away from it is hard, especially for most people who just use their computer to surf the internet and/or play games. Especially since it's a "chat app for *gamers*".

So I did what any decent programmer would do and made my own chat encryption program. On surface level, this seems like an idiotic idea - I mean, there's so many encryption programs out there, why would I make my own?

Well most apps (or at least, every app I found) seemed to concentrate on encrypting the bits of the file. This meant that I would have to do 5 things - open a text editor, write my message, save the file, and encrypt it, and then send it. For *every single message*. Is it just me or is that ***very*** inefficient?

So I developed Ceaser++. What I like to call the *stupidly simple encryption program* - an encryption method based on the Ceaser Cipher. And a very user-friendly (I hope!) app for it. So that encryption - of messages - is something anyone can do.

I hate people who just leave their source code so everyone has to build the program. So, you can download the program from the **releases** section at the right hand side of the page.
